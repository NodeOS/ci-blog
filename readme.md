## What is ci-blog?

`ci-blog` is a blogging middleware for GitHub Pages (aka Jekyll). It grabs repo
issues with tags like 'blog' to generate posts which are then committed to a
GitHub Pages repository. Combining this with any continuous integration service
and a webhook can create a simple, auto-updating blogging workflow for your
project.
